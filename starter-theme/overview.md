_¹ Sage's Controller is more of a View Composer than a Controller._

_² Sage's Controller provides similar functionality but is limited to 1 composer (controller) per view and vice versa._

_³ Timber does not provide a front-end build process so you can implement whatever you prefer._

### Notable directories

#### `app/helpers/`

Add PHP helper files here. Helper files should include __function definitions only__. See below for information on where to put actions, filters, classes etc.

#### `app/src/`

Add PHP class files here. All clases in the `App\` namespace are autoloaded in accordance with [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).

#### `resources/images/`

Add images for styling here. Optimized copies will be placed in `dist/images/` when running the build process.

#### `resources/styles/frontend/`

Add .css and .scss files to add them to the front-end bundle. Don't forget to `@import` them in `index.scss`.

#### `resources/styles/[admin,editor,login]/`

These directories are for the admin, editor and login bundles, respectively. They work identically to the main `resources/styles/frontend/` directory.

#### `resources/scripts/frontend/`

Add JavaScript files here to add them to the front-end bundle. The entry point is `index.js`.

#### `resources/scripts/[admin,editor,login]/`

These directories are for the admin, editor and login bundles, respectively. They work identically to the main `resources/scripts/frontend/` directory.

#### `theme/`

Add views in this, the `theme/partials/` or the `theme/templates/` directories accordingly. Avoid adding any PHP logic here, unless it pertains to layouting (PHP logic should go into helper files or [WP Emerge controllers](/framework/routing/controllers))
