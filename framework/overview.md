üì¶ A micro framework which modernizes WordPress as a CMS development by providing tools to implement MVC and more.

üî• Integration is incremental - you can use it only on the pages you want or on all pages.

‚ù§ If you've used frameworks such as Laravel, Slim or Symfony you will love WP Emerge.

üöÄ Also, make sure you check out the [WP Emerge Starter Theme](https://github.com/htmlburger/wpemerge-theme) project.

_¬π We are comparing frameworks and themes - style, build tools etc. are not mentioned. For a full comparison check out the [WP Emerge Starter Theme](/starter-theme/overview)._

_¬≤ WP Emerge is theme agnostic - you can use it in any theme._

_¬≥ Sage's Controller is more of a View Composer than a Controller._

_‚Å¥ Sage's Controller provides similar functionality but is limited to 1 composer (controller) per view and vice versa._

_Email any factual inaccuracies to [hi@atanas.dev](mailto:hi@atanas.dev) so they can be corrected._

## Requirements

- [PHP](http://php.net/) >= 5.5
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) >= 4.7
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Features

#### Routes with custom URLs or dynamic conditions

```php
Route::get()->url( '/' )->handle( 'HomeController@index' );

Route::get()
    ->url( '/custom' )
    ->query( function ( $query_vars ) {
        return [
            // WP_Query query vars go here ...
        ];
    } )
    ->handle( 'CustomController@custom' );

Route::get()
    ->where( 'post_id', get_option( 'page_on_front' ) )
    ->handle( 'HomeController@index' );

Route::get()
    ->where( function() {
        return is_front_page();
    } );
    ->handle( 'HomeController@index' );
```

- Enable the use of controllers to compartmentalize your business logic away from your presentation.
- Use existing routes or add new ones.
- Use built-in dynamic route conditions or define your own custom ones.
- Use anonymous functions for quick one-off conditions.

---

#### Controllers

```php
class HomeController {
    public function index( $request ) {
        $name = $request->get( 'name' );
        return \WPEmerge\view( 'templates/home.php' )
            ->with( [
                'welcome' => 'Welcome, ' . $name . '!',
            ] );
    }
}
```

- Separate unrelated business logic into controllers, and related business logic into controller methods.
- Receive an object representing the current request and respond with a PSR-7 response.
- Use different methods for different routes.
- Respond with a view, json, a redirect etc.
- Easy to test.

---

#### Middleware

```php
Route::get()
    ->url( '/' )
    ->middleware( ['user.can:manage_options', 'minify'] )
    ->handle( 'HomeController@index' );
```

- Hook before and/or after controller methods.
- Add globally or to specific routes or route groups.
- Powers features such as Flash and OldInput.

---

#### [PSR-7](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Responses

```php
class HomeController {
    public function index( $request ) {
        return \WPEmerge\response()
            ->withHeader( 'X-Custom-Header', 'foo' );
    }
}
```

- Use PSR-7 objects for your responses.
- Easy to stream and modify before outputting.
- Uses Guzzle's implementation - [read more](https://github.com/guzzle/psr7).

---

#### View Composers

```php
View::addComposer( 'templates/about-us', function( $view ) {
    $view->with( ['hello' => 'world'] );
} );
```

- Pass generic context to partials regardless of which controller or parent view uses them.
- Work with any View engine (Php, Blade, Twig).

---

#### Service container

```php
// Run this inside the register() method of a service provider.
$container['my_service'] = function( $container ) {
    return new MyService( $container['my_dependency'] );
};
```

- Define your dependencies in a service container.
- Override any and all WP Emerge dependencies when needed.
- Enables dependency injection.
- Uses Pimple - [read more](https://pimple.symfony.com/).

---

#### Service providers

```php
class MyServiceProvider implements ServiceProviderInterface {
    public function register( $container ) {
        $container['my_service'] = function( $container ) {
            return new MyService( $container['my_dependency'] );
        };
    }

    public function boot( $container ) {
        // bootstrap code if needed
    }
}
```

- Register dependencies into the service container and boot them, if needed.
- Enables to split your dependencies logically into separate providers.
- WP Emerge's own dependencies are setup via Service providers.

---

#### PHP View Layouts

`index.php`
```php
<?php
/**
* Layout: layouts/app.php
*/

if ( is_single() ) {
    \WPEmerge\render( ['loop-single', 'loop'] );
} else {
    \WPEmerge\render( 'loop' );
}
```
`layouts/app.php`
```php
<?php
\WPEmerge\render( 'header' );

if ( ! is_singular() ) {
	app_the_title( '<h2 class="post-title">', '</h2>' );
}

\WPEmerge\layout_content();

\WPEmerge\render( 'sidebar' );

\WPEmerge\render( 'footer' );
```

- Eliminate repeating `get_header()`/`get_footer()` calls in every view.
- Reduce boilerplate and improve maintainability of views without sacrificing flexibility.

---

#### Custom view engine support

```php
// Run this inside the register() method of a service provider.
$container[ WPEMERGE_VIEW_ENGINE_KEY ] = function( $container ) {
    return new MyViewEngine();
};
```

- Replace the view engine used in the service container.
- Blade and Twig available as add-on packages.
- You can even write your own view engine and use it seamlessly.
