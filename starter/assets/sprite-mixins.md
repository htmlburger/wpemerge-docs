# Sprite Mixins

Adding images inside the `resources/images/sprite/` directory will prepare them for sprite usage. To use a sprite image in your styles you can employ one of the automatically generated SASS mixins in `resources/styles/_sprite.scss`.
In addition, a variable will be defined for every sprite image which you will use as a reference in mixins (e.g. `birds.jpg` becomes `$birds`).

!> `resources/styles/_sprite.scss` is an automatically generated file - never modify it manually.

## Examples
1. Add a sprite image as a background:
    ```scss
    .foo {
        @include sprite-image($birds);
    }
    ```

2. Add a sprite image as a background and set the element's width and height to the exact dimensions of the image:
    ```scss
    .foo {
        @include sprite($birds);
    }
    ```

3. Set an element's height to be equal to a sprite image's height:
    ```scss
    .foo {
        @include sprite-height($birds);
    }
    ```

Refer to the generated comments inside `resources/styles/_sprite.scss` for more information and examples.

## Retina Support

To enable retina support for sprites follow these steps:

1. Edit `resources/build/webpack.js` and uncomment the following line:
    ```js
    // retina: '@2x',
    ```
2. Restart the dev process if you have it running.
3. For every image you have in `resources/images/sprite/`, create a retina copy with `@2x` added as a suffix to the filename (e.g. `foo.jpg` should have a `foo@2x.jpg` retina version).
4. Replace mixin usage with the appropriate retina counterpart and add a `-group` suffix to your sprite variable (e.g. `@include sprite($birds);` becomes `@include retina-sprite($birds-group);`)

That's it! Completing the above steps ensures the build process will add relevant media queries to replace the sprite image references with the retina version for suitable devices.
